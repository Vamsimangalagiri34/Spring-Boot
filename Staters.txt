 Spring Boot, starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors you can include in your application to quickly set up commonly used libraries and configurations. They help reduce boilerplate and simplify dependency management.

 ✅ Common Spring Boot Starters:
🔥 spring-boot-starter
Basic starter that includes core Spring Boot dependencies.

core dependencies in Spring Boot, we mean modules that help with:

🧠 Bean Identification & Dependency Injection
Spring identifies components (beans) using annotations like @Component, @Service, @Repository, etc., and automatically wires them where needed using @Autowired.

🔄 Lifecycle Management
Spring manages the entire lifecycle of a bean—from creation to destruction. You can hook into this lifecycle using annotations like @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy.

🧰 Utility Support
It includes various utility classes for reflection, collections, string handling, resource loading, and more, simplifying Java development.

⚙️ Auto-Configuration
Spring Boot configures your application automatically based on the libraries you’ve added. For example, if you add Spring Web, it auto-configures an embedded Tomcat server.

These features are part of the foundation layer of Spring, bundled with spring-boot-starter, so you don’t have to configure them manually. It’s what makes Spring Boot development fast and hassle-free. ⚡


🌱 spring-boot-starter-parent – What It Does:
🧩 Manages Versions Consistently
It provides a central place for version control of all dependencies. You don’t need to declare versions for most Spring Boot dependencies—


1	spring-boot-starter	It is used for core starter, including auto-configuration support, logging, and YAML.
2	spring-boot-starter-parent	It provides default configurations for the application. Once you include this in your POM.xml, you don't need to specify the version number of an artifact

📦 Default Java Version
It sets the default Java version (like Java 17) unless overridden.


🌐 spring-boot-starter-web
Builds web, RESTful applications using Spring MVC and embedded Tomcat.

📦 spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
Used for Spring Data JPA with Hibernate; enables database operations.

🔐 spring-boot-starter-security
Adds Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

💬 spring-boot-starter-validation
Provides bean validation support using Hibernate Validator.

📊 spring-boot-starter-actuator
Gives production-ready features like monitoring, metrics, and health checks.

📄 spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
Supports Thymeleaf templating engine for web views.

🔁 spring-boot-starter-aop
Supports aspect-oriented programming (AOP) using Spring AOP and AspectJ.

🐞 spring-boot-starter-test
Includes testing libraries like JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Test.

These starters make it easier to build powerful Spring applications without worrying about individual dependencies and versions.
